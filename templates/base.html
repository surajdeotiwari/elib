        <span class="h3">Technical Overview</span>
        <ul>
            <img src="../static/database-elib.png" alt="database" class="img-fluid">
            <p>
                Important user information including an ID, photo, username, email, type (staff or student, for example), branch (if
                relevant), phone number, and fine balance are all captured by the user model. User administration and authentication
                within the system are made easier by this architecture.
            <p>

                The Books model is a representation of individual books in the library that holds information about each book, including
                its title, author, publisher, date of release, image, file location, reservation status, issue date, return deadline,
                topic, and bio.
                This paradigm makes it possible to organize, track, and catalog library resources effectively.

            </p>
            <p>
                Book authors' names, biographies, and photo paths are all stored in the Author model.
                This paradigm makes it easier for books to be associated with their individual authors and improves the browsing
                experience for people who are interested in the works of particular writers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last but not least, user activity logs, comprising usernames, user IDs, and timestamps for login and logout, are
                recorded by the Logs model. The insights this model offers regarding user behavior and usage patterns of the system help
                with system security and monitoring.
            </p>
            <p>
                All things considered, the supplied code establishes the framework for a strong library management system, giving
                administrators the ability to effectively arrange library materials, oversee user accounts, and keep an eye on system
                activity.
